# Churn Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on telecom data. It includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing (with SMOTE), and baseline models such as logistic regression and random forest.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, preprocessing, and modeling
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/wissalzoghbi/churn-forecast-ml.git
cd churn-forecast-ml

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv newproject
newproject\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch Jupyter:

jupyter notebook
